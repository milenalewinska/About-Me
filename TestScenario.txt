Test Scenarios are created to ensure that every functionality a website or app offers is working as expected. It is best to gather input from clients, stakeholders, and developers to create real/accurate test scenarios. This helps effectively cover all possible user scenarios and enables comprehensive testing of all business flows of the software in question.
In other words, it's an overview of the core functionalities that are to be tested in an application feature.

A test scenario contains a list of low-level test requirements called test cases. 
These test cases are necessary for checking that all required functionalities of a feature work properly.

Test scenarios are important because they help ensure proper test coverage, guarantee that all core functionality is working as intended, and help quantify and track testing efforts.
