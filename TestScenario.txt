Test Scenarios are created to ensure that every functionality a website or app offers is working as expected. It is best to gather input from clients, stakeholders, and developers to create real/accurate test scenarios. This helps effectively cover all possible user scenarios and enables comprehensive testing of all business flows of the software in question.

Test Scenarios are required to verify the entire system’s performance from the users’ perspective. When creating them, testers need to place themselves in the users’ shoes to clarify what real-world scenarios the software will have to handle when made public.
